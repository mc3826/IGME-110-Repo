# Vocal Synths I Like
Vocal synthesizers are electronic musical instruments that take recorded voice samples to produce and mimic a person singing. Most well-known vocal synths are Japanese with Hatsune Miku paving the way. 

I'll be listing vocal synths that I listen to a lot/enjoy their voice even if I don't listen to them as much. I also have a bias for older voicebanks. I like my vocaloids crunchy and robotic! 

Some vocaloids have voicebanks that have moved companies/programs (like Teto moving from UTAU to SynthV). In those cases, I'll be catagorizing them by which voicebank I like the most and where it's on. This is the reason why I don't have a SynthV catagory lol.
