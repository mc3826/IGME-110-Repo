# Vocal Synths I Like
Vocal synthesizers are electronic musical instruments that take recorded voice samples to produce and mimic a person singing. Most well-known vocal synths are Japanese with Hatsune Miku paving the way. 

I'll be listing vocal synths that I listen to a lot/enjoy their voice even if I don't listen to them as much. I also have a bias for older voicebanks. I like my vocaloids crunchy and robotic! 

Some vocaloids have voicebanks that have moved companies/programs (like Teto moving from UTAU to SynthV). In those cases, I'll be catagorizing them by which voicebank I like the most and where it's on. This is the reason why I don't have a SynthV catagory lol.

# Crypton
## KAITO
My favorite vocaloid of all time. I have two plushies of him and all of my keychains are him. All of the producers who used his **KAITO V1** voicebank made me fall in love. I would list them, but I'm a gatekeepr at heart. He sounds wonderful in folklore and electronic songs. Everyone who unironically doesn't like his voice or says he sounds like Kermit (ONLY SLIGHTLY IN HIS ENGLISH VOICEBANK, BUT ALSO NOT REALLY AT ALL) must have something wrong with their ears. Naoto Fuuga (his voice provider) is also an angel and calls **KAITO** his son. He's just so perfect. I love him.

## MEIKO
I mean **MEIKO** and KAITO are meant to compliment each other's voices. I have to put her on here because she can hit some amazing notes. I really love the folklore songs that use her. My only gripe is that I wish they hadn't pitched her up so high. People don't really do that anymore, thankfully. (EXCEPT CRYPTON WITH THEIR NT VOICEBANKS)


# Yamaha
## VY2
A really close second to KAITO. His voicebank quality is insane and his voice is so smooth. momocashew, the pioneer that you are. Yamaha really blew it out of the park with both of the VYs. I also really like the VY concept of having an actual blank canvas so every fan design is valid. However, I'm a **Roro** superfan, even if that one black haired design fits his official sword design more. This is partially due to Manbo-P's art style, but there's so much badass **Roro** fanart. Go, my pink scene boy. We DO NOT talk about the A.I.VOICE nor **Yuuma's** BORING snoozefest of a design. He got corporatized </3. Give him back his hair dye. 

## VY1
It would be a crime to leave out **VY1**. Her official hairpin and fan, and contest winner designs are beautiful. Her voice is absolutely gorgeous and her range is so broad. How can I talk about the VY's and not mention EZFG. Absolute icon that helped popularize them. *Cyber Thunder Cider* is definitely my favorite song out of their discography. The vocamash with Cyber Thunder Cider and Hurting for a Very Hurtful Pain is so good too (despite the mixing issues). Waiter, waiter! More VY1 originals please!

## ZOLA Project
All three of them, I love. However, I like WIL the most. (can you tell I enjoy deeper voicebanks?) Also, MioDioDaVinci being THE **ZOLA Project** artist. He even got to do the demo for their V6 voicebanks! I forget about **ZOLA Project** sometimes, but I hold a lot of love for them. They're a nostalgic group to me. 


# Internet Co Ltd
## Gakupo
**Camui/Kamui Gakupo/Gackpoid** whatever, you know who he is. We're never getting another **Gakupo** voicebank with GACKT's condition and also his weird controversies (vkei bands/singers try not to get into a controversy challenge IMPOSSIBLE), but it's alright. This samurai serves the old fashion way. Lucifer carrying Gakupo's legacy, cover by cover. His voice is lovely. I love Re:nG's *接吻は刹那 -DISCLOSER ver-* and the art. Re:nG carrying **Gakupo** originals for me.

## Lily
She's got a great, unique voice, but... NAME A LILY ORIGINAL NOT BY NIKI CHALLENGE (IMPOSSIBLE) Yes, I put **Lily** on here just because of niki. His songs, to me, are nostalgic, yet timeless. I love electronic rock so much. 


# AH Software Co Ltd
## Hiyama Kiyoteru
He's got silly lore, but a voice that can work for both pop and rock. **Kiyoteru's** V2 can be a little funky, but that's just the charm of it all. + his V4 voicebanks is a great improvement. 

## Nekomura Iroha
Hello Kitty transfem (headcanon) icon with a transman voice provider. **IROHA** AND KYONOUSUKE, CONGRATS ON THE SYNTHV 2 RELEASE! I am actively listening to her demo songs. My wonderful kittyler with her new, giant Hello Kitty lightsticks. All of her designs are so cute and the mature voice contrasting it is so peak. **Nekomura Iroha**, you will always be famous. 


# Shanghai HENIAN 
## Luo Tianyi
THE Chinese Vocaloid. **Luo Tianyi** is so famous in the Chinese sphere, she even collaborated with To Be Hero X's Lucky Cyan in the song, *Lucky Resonance* (幸运共鸣). She also performed Gokuraku Joudo by GARNiDELiA on stage. That's Tianyi right there!

## Yuezheng Longya
Beautiful design, beautiful voice. I beg of you, please listen to Chinese vocaloids outside of Yi Xi butcher vanity PLEASE.

# Ki oon Music Inc
## Utatane Piko
Made this catagory just for **Piko**. He deserves it, he got discontinued. A very nostalgic vocaloid for me. Remember hits even harder now. 


# UTAU
## Matsudappoiyo
I love **Matsudappoiyo** so much, don't even joke. He's got such a crazy range. He can sound so powerful in one song and so soft in another So many of OMYO's covers have become emotional supports and **PPoiyo's** character is so relatable. I love him in ways I cannot articulate. Say one bad thing about him and it's on sight. I also make UTAU covers with him! I used to be a mac user and whenever I tried to use his edge voicebank, he would refuse to sing no matter how much I tried. So, I switched over to being an against main and now it's my favorite voicebank. Matsuda Toki, you have gifted the internet something irreplacable.

## Makimiya Fuuki
I recently got into him and his voice blew my mind. Boredom and rock are my favorite voicebanks. I can't tell if it's just the art style, but **Makimiya** is so short and then his voice is so :boom: I like to pretend that the art in the **Makimiya** cover of *With a Dance Number*

## Rook
At first, I got him to voice a friend's oc in a cover I made for their birthday. Then, I eventually got attached and I'm planning to make more covers with him. I have a *BC* by niki cover already, just haven't made it public.
