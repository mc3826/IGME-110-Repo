# Vocal Synths I Like
Vocal synthesizers are electronic musical instruments that take recorded voice samples to produce and mimic a person singing. Most well-known vocal synths are Japanese with Hatsune Miku paving the way. 

I'll be listing vocal synths that I listen to a lot/enjoy their voice even if I don't listen to them as much. I also have a bias for older voicebanks. I like my vocaloids crunchy and robotic! 

Some vocaloids have voicebanks that have moved companies/programs (like Teto moving from UTAU to SynthV). In those cases, I'll be catagorizing them by which voicebank I like the most and where it's on. This is the reason why I don't have a SynthV catagory lol.

# Crypton
## KAITO
My favorite vocaloid of all time. I have two plushies of him and all of my keychains are him. All of the producers who used his **KAITO V1** voicebank made me fall in love. I would list them, but I'm a gatekeepr at heart. He sounds wonderful in folklore and electronic songs. Everyone who unironically doesn't like his voice or says he sounds like Kermit (ONLY SLIGHTLY IN HIS ENGLISH VOICEBANK, BUT ALSO NOT REALLY AT ALL) must have something wrong with their ears. Naoto Fuuga (his voice provider) is also an angel and calls **KAITO** his son. He's just so perfect. I love him.

## MEIKO
I mean **MEIKO** and KAITO are meant to compliment each other's voices. I have to put her on here because she can hit some amazing notes. I really love the folklore songs that use her. My only gripe is that I wish they hadn't pitched her up so high. People don't really do that anymore, thankfully. (EXCEPT CRYPTON WITH THEIR NT VOICEBANKS. GO EXPLODE!)

# Yamaha
## VY2
A really close second to KAITO. His voicebank quality is insane and his voice is so smooth. momocashew, the pioneer that you are. Yamaha really blew it out of the park with both of the VYs. I also really like the VY concept of having an actual blank canvas so every fan design is valid. However, I'm a **Roro** superfan, even if that one black haired design fits his official sword design more. This is partially due to Manbo-P's art style, but there's so much badass **Roro** fanart. Go, my pink scene boy. We DO NOT talk about the A.I.VOICE nor **VY2**'s BORING snoozefest of a design. He got corporatized ðŸ’” Give him back his hair dye.
